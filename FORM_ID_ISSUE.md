# ðŸ”§ How to Get Your Form's Field IDs

## The Issue
We're using your correct form ID (`1YHuc_Ib_0WhHGN1-hv1qWb1V0o9ctVDLCLxtdjfcGGs`) but we need the field IDs from YOUR actual form, not from a different form.

## Quick Fix Steps:

### Step 1: Open Your Form for Editing
1. Go to: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YHuc_Ib_0WhHGN1-hv1qWb1V0o9ctVDLCLxtdjfcGGs/edit
2. Make sure you're logged into the Google account that owns this form

### Step 2: Get the Viewform URL
1. Click the "Preview" button (eye icon) in your form editor
2. This will open your form in view mode
3. Copy the complete URL from the address bar

### Step 3: View Source Code
1. On the preview page, right-click anywhere on the page
2. Select "View Page Source" or "View Source"
3. Copy ALL the HTML source code

### Step 4: Send Me the Source
Paste the entire HTML source code so I can extract the correct field IDs for your form.

## Alternative Quick Test Method

If you want to test immediately, I can create a simple test version that submits to a different service first to verify the data flow, then we can fix the Google Forms integration.

Would you like to:
A) Get your form's source code for proper field mapping
B) Set up a temporary test endpoint to verify data flow
C) Try a different approach to Google Forms integration
