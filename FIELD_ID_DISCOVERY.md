# üîç Field ID Discovery Method

Since we can't easily access your form's source code, let's use a different approach to find the correct field IDs.

## Method 1: Network Inspector Approach

1. Go to your form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YHuc_Ib_0WhHGN1-hv1qWb1V0o9ctVDLCLxtdjfcGGs/viewform
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to "Network" tab
4. Fill out the form manually
5. Submit the form
6. Look at the POST request to see the actual field names

## Method 2: Create New Form with Known Structure

Alternative: I can help you create a new Google Form that matches exactly what our code expects, so we have full control over the field IDs.

## Method 3: Use a Universal Field Mapping

I can create code that automatically detects and maps fields based on labels rather than hardcoded IDs.

Which approach would you prefer?
