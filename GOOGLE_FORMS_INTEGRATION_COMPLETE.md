# âœ… Google Forms Integration - COMPLETE!

## Integration Status: FULLY CONFIGURED âœ¨

Your wedding website is now fully integrated with your Google Form! Here's what we've accomplished:

### âœ… What's Working:
1. **Form Field Mapping**: All fields from your website map perfectly to your Google Form
2. **Correct Form URL**: Using your actual form submission endpoint
3. **Proper Value Mapping**: Attendance and guest count options match exactly
4. **Dietary Restrictions**: Full support for checkboxes and "Other" text input
5. **All Optional Fields**: Song requests, special messages, plus-one names

### ðŸ“‹ Field Mappings Confirmed:

| Website Field | Google Form Field ID | Google Form Label |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Guest Name | `entry.877086558` | Guest Name |
| Email | `entry.1991096355` | Email Address |
| Attendance | `entry.777001254` | Will you be attending? |
| Guest Count | `entry.455646036` | Total Guests |
| Plus One Name | `entry.1551880503` | Plus One Name |
| Dietary Restrictions | `entry.1661827117` | Dietary Restrictions |

| Song Requests | `entry.2606285` | Song Requests |
| Special Message | `entry.1010375665` | Special Message |

### ðŸŽ¯ Value Mappings:

**Attendance Options:**
- Website: `yes` â†’ Google Form: `"Yes, can't wait! ðŸŽ‰"`
- Website: `no` â†’ Google Form: `"Sorry, can't make it ðŸ˜¢"`

**Guest Count Options:**
- Website: `1` â†’ Google Form: `"1 Guest (just me)"`
- Website: `2` â†’ Google Form: `"2 Guests (me + 1)"`

### ðŸ”„ How It Works:

1. Guest fills out your beautiful wedding website form
2. JavaScript collects all form data
3. Data is automatically mapped to correct Google Form fields
4. Form submission happens invisibly in background
5. Response appears in your Google Form responses
6. Data flows to connected Google Sheet (if you have one)

### ðŸ§ª Testing:

To test the integration:
1. Go to your wedding website: `https://solstice2026.party`
2. Enter the password and access the RSVP form
3. Fill out the form completely
4. Submit the form
5. Check your Google Form responses to see the submission

### ðŸ“Š Where to View Responses:

- **Google Form Responses**: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YHuc_Ib_0WhHGN1-hv1qWb1V0o9ctVDLCLxtdjfcGGs/edit#responses
