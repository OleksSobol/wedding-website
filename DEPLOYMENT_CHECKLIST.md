# Deployment Checklist ‚úÖ

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### ‚úÖ Code Quality & Cleanup
- [x] Removed obsolete Google Forms scraping code
- [x] Cleaned up unnecessary documentation files  
- [x] Removed empty directories
- [x] Google Sheets API properly implemented
- [x] Error handling and debugging in place

### ‚úÖ Google Sheets API Configuration
- [x] Sheet ID configured: `1eJR55LarlRcF8xMu1A_uqvvClij13-WkOAaX3MrAVjQ`
- [x] API Key configured: `AIzaSyAv7uhsJUWewSWg_owpVTbNa4qgXyrbFHc`
- [x] Range set to: `Sheet1!A:I`
- [x] Proper error handling for API failures
- [x] Local testing mode implemented

### ‚úÖ Security Measures
- [x] API key restricted to Google Sheets API only
- [x] Domain restrictions should be set in Google Cloud Console
- [x] No sensitive credentials in frontend (API key is public-safe for Sheets)
- [x] Form validation and sanitization in place

### ‚úÖ Functionality Check
- [x] RSVP form data collection working
- [x] Google Sheets API submission implemented
- [x] Success/error handling properly implemented
- [x] Local storage backup working
- [x] Debug logging for troubleshooting

## Google Sheets Structure Verification

Your Google Sheet should have these headers in row 1:
```
A: Timestamp
B: Guest Name  
C: Email Address
D: Will you be attending?
E: Total Guests
F: Plus One Name
G: Dietary Restrictions
H: Song Requests
I: Special Message
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Verify Google Cloud Console Settings**:
   - API key is restricted to Google Sheets API
   - Add your Netlify domain to authorized referrers
   - Quota limits are sufficient (default is more than enough)

2. **Test Locally First**:
   ```bash
   # Start local development server
   npm run dev
   # Fill out the form - should show "LOCAL TESTING MODE" in console
   ```

3. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Final cleanup and deployment preparation"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Post-Deployment Testing**:
   - Submit a test RSVP
   - Check browser console for any errors
   - Verify data appears in Google Sheets
   - Test on mobile devices

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

### ‚úÖ Successful Submission
```
Console output:
üìä Submitting RSVP to Google Sheets...
üìã Data being submitted: {name: "Test User", ...}
‚úÖ Successfully submitted RSVP to Google Sheets!
üìä Response: {spreadsheetId: "...", updates: {...}}
```

### ‚ùå Common Issues & Solutions

**API Key Invalid**:
- Check Google Cloud Console API key
- Verify Sheets API is enabled
- Check referrer restrictions

**Permission Denied**:
- Ensure Google Sheet is publicly accessible
- Check sharing settings: "Anyone with the link can view"

**CORS Errors**:
- This shouldn't happen with Sheets API (unlike Forms)
- If it does, check domain restrictions

## Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Google Sheets**: Check for new submissions
- **Browser Console**: Monitor for any errors
- **API Quotas**: Check Google Cloud Console (very unlikely to hit limits)
